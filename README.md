Developed my own version of Hashmap and Queue data structures.

The Queue data structure has been designed using a singly linked list and the Hashmap by the Queue. 

All implementations are generic which allows for different data types when each of the queue and hashmap objects are instantiated.

To allow users to access multiple custom iterators for the data structures, Iterator Design Pattern has been implemented.
